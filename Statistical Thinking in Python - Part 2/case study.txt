# EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches
# For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth 
# (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens 
# has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending 
# on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was 
# some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. 
# These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.

# In the next few problems, you will look at the beak depth of G. scandens on 
# Daphne Major in 1975 and in 2012. To start with, let's plot all of the beak 
# depth measurements in 1975 and 2012 in a bee swarm plot.

# The data are stored in a pandas DataFrame called df with columns 'year' 
# and 'beak_depth'. The units of beak depth are millimeters (mm).

# Create bee swarm plot
_ = sns.swarmplot(x='year',y='beak_depth',data=df)

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('year')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

## It is kind of hard to see if there is a clear difference between the 1975 and 2012 
# data set. Eyeballing it, it appears as though the mean of the 2012 data set might 
# be slightly higher, and it might have a bigger variance.

######################
# ECDFs of beak depths
# While bee swarm plots are useful, we found that ECDFs are often even better when doing 
# EDA. Plot the ECDFs for the 1975 and 2012 beak depth measurements on the same plot.
# For your convenience, the beak depths for the respective years has been stored in 
# the NumPy arrays bd_1975 and bd_2012.

# Compute ECDFs
x_1975, y_1975 = ecdf(bd_1975)
x_2012, y_2012 = ecdf(bd_2012)

# Plot the ECDFs
_ = plt.plot(x_1975, y_1975, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_2012, y_2012, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set margins
plt.margins(0.02)

# Add axis labels and legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='lower right')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

## The differences are much clearer in the ECDF. The mean is larger in the 2012 data, 
# and the variance does appear larger as well.

# Parameter estimates of beak depths
Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.

Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.
